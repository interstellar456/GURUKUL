###Damn Small Linux 

You should try out Damn Small Linux. It's meant to run on really old machines with less ram and CPU.

Damn Small Linux is a business card size (50MB) live CD Linux distribution. 
Despite its minuscule size it strives to have a functional and easy to use desktop. 
Damn Small Linux has a nearly complete desktop, including XMMS (MP3, and MPEG), FTP client, 
links-hacked web browser, spreadsheet, email, spellcheck (US English), a word-processor, 
three editors (Nedit, nVi, Zile [emacs clone]), Xpdf, Worker (file manager), Naim (AIM, ICQ, IRC),
VNCviwer, SSH/SCP server and client, DHCP client, PPP, PPPoE, a web server, calculator, Fluxbox window manager, 
system monitoring apps, USB support, and soon it will have PCMCIA support as well.
If you like Damn Small Linux you can install it on your hard drive. 
Because all the applications are small and light it makes a very good choice for older hardware


###Rocket Chip 
Absolutely, the Berkeley Rocket core (now available at freechipsproject/rocket-chip ) runs Linux. 
You can run in FPGA. SiFive is working on a 28nm version of this core and will be selling it soon.

My research team has used this core in a 16nm TSMC SoC with 5-Linux capable 64-bit Rocket RISC-V cores and 496 32-bit RISC-V cores.
